Project Overview

This project is built using the MERN stack:
	â€¢	MongoDB â€“ for database storage
	â€¢	Express.js â€“ for backend server and routing
	â€¢	React â€“ for the frontend UI
	â€¢	Node.js â€“ for server runtime environment



Prerequisites
	â€¢	Node.js (v18 or newer)
	â€¢	npm (comes with Node.js)




Project Setup

Folder structure:
SCORE-SYNC/
â”œâ”€â”€ backend/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ User.js          # Mongoose schema for users
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ routes/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.js          # Handles /api/auth/login and /api/auth/register
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ server.js            # Main backend entry point
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ .env                 # Environment variables (MongoDB URI, Port)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ package.json

â””â”€â”€ frontend/
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.js           # React frontend logic
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.css          # Styling for the login/register UI
    â”œâ”€â”€ package.json



Database Connection
	â€¢	The backend connects to MongoDB Atlas using mongoose.connect() inside server.js.
	â€¢	Connection details are stored in .env:

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/ScoreSync
PORT=5050




Running the Project

	â€¢	The backend and frontend have been configured to start in unison.
		Upon "cd" into /score-sync, the npm start command can be run to star
		both the front and backend.
		-If errors are returned, attempt to run "npm install" in the /score-sync
		folder.
		
    â€¢ BACKEND TERMINAL
        Make sure you are in the 'backend' directory of the project and run:
        npm run dev

        You should see:
        âœ… MongoDB connected
        ðŸš€ Server running on http://127.0.0.1:5050

    â€¢ FRONTEND TERMINAL
        Make sure you are in the 'frontend' directory of the project and run:
        npm start

        You should see:
        A browser pop-up with the login page
